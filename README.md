## Learning Highlights

- Basic use of TypeScript to leverage typing.
- Further practice of modular development and bundling with Webpack.
- Further use of local storage for tasks and projects.
- Practice UX with some features such as modals, dynamic filtering, edit menu within the sidebar.
- CSS styling and UX was a minor concern in this learning project, so only basic styling/ UX was applied.

## Reflection on Vanilla JavaScript

While building this project using vanilla JavaScript (TypeScript), I encountered significant challenges related to creating, updating, and managing DOM elements dynamically.

Although the project was functional, the following limitations became clear:

- Verbosity: Manipulating the DOM directly required extensive code. Tasks like creating elements, appending children, and updating attributes often involved repetitive and verbose code.
- State Management: Keeping track of application state, such as the active project or the tasks list, became increasingly complex as the app grew. This led to a higher chance of bugs and harder debugging.
- Code Readability: With the frequent need to query and update DOM elements manually, the codebase became cluttered and harder to maintain.

While very challenging, this was a great hands-on learning opportunity. It developed my knowledge of vanilla JS/TS but also made me very ready and eager to start learning about frameworks.
